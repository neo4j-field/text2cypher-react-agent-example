Final Answer: Based on the database schema, there is no information or relationship available that indicates which streaming platforms have the rights to stream each movie. The schema contains information about movies, actors, directors, genres, user ratings, and some basic movie metadata, but it does not include any node or property related to streaming platforms or their licensing rights.

Final Answer: Based on the schema of the movie database, there are no nodes or relationships indicating detailed production costs broken down by department for each movie. The only related property is the overall "budget" on the Movie node, but there are no department-level production cost breakdowns available in the current database structure.

If you are looking for the overall budget of each movie, I can provide that information. However, breakdowns by department (like art, camera, departmental costs, etc.) are not available according to the database schema. If you need those specifics, you might consider supplementing with external data or clarifying if there is another way you would like to approach movie cost analysis.
